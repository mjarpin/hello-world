# hello-world
First coding project!! 
My name is Madeline and I am excited to be learning to code! 
It is scary to learn and knew thing and easy to expect myself to be good at it right away.  
While I am learning to code I am also going to be learning to be patient with myself and let myself make mistakes along the way.
